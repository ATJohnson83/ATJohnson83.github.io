              <p>I am a full-stack web developer currently seeking an opportunity for employment in this industry.  I am completing a six month, intensive, full stack coding bootcamp at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in December.  Before this course, I had a very basic knowledge of HTML, CSS.  I now can confidently call my self a Full Stack Developer.  We have covered a huge range of subjects including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, API's, AJAX, JSON, Firebase, Node.js, mySql, Express, RESTful APIs, MongoDB, Scraping, Testing, TDD, React, and much more.  I have been able to use this knowledge combined with my other skills, interests and creativity to create some applications that I am proud to show off, especially considering I could barely write a basic html/css page when i came to this class.</p>
              <br />
              <p>Prior to persuing a career in tech, I was a Jazz Pianist, living in New Orleans, freelancing and touring with the Jason Marsalis Vibes Quartet.  After many years of making a living as a musician, I decided it would be in my best interest to develop another skill set that could provide a more stable career path.  After taking a free intro to web developement course through Coursera, I knew that this was something I wanted to persue.  Like music, it required Skill, Craft, Creativity, a Hard Work Ethic, the Ability to work in a group, and more.  Im glad to say I made the right decision, and everyday i am more fascinated and excited about the possibilities that this field offers.  I have developed a keen eye and passion for using technology to solve problems that I see in my current job as a Masonry Project Manager, in everyday life, and through talking to friends about challanges in their jobs.  My dream is to gain employment as a webdeveloper as part of a team that will challange me and make me better, while continuing to create applications that satisfy my creativity and goal to use tech to enrich lives. </p>
