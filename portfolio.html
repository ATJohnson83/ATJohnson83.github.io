                  <p>This application was initally built to meet the requirements for  the Second Major Project during my time as a Student at the UNC coding bootcamp.  The idea behind this project originated as an attempt to create more efficiency and save time during my job at Whitman Masonry.  I was assigned the task of researching and implementing an Incentive based pay system, in which employees were rewarded based directly on their work output instead of bonuses or raises.  In order to do this, I had to get daily production reports from each of the foremen at every job which showed the amount of materials they installed/ the number and breakdown of their personel/ and the amount of hours they worked.  After several unsuccesful attempts of getting this info, including text messages and printed out paper handouts, I decided to use my new coding skills to create an app that could potentially make this process much less painless and efficient.</p>
                  <p>The first screen is a login screen.  The user can either sign in as a Manager or a Foreman.  For demo purposes all passwords are set to "test" so you can log in a play with the app.  If a foreman logs in, they are taken to a mobile responsive page that is intended to be viewed on an Iphone (all of our foremen had iphones).  They then fill out the daily report and press submit.  This would ideally be done at the end of everyday.  The management can then log in and choose to view reports.  There is an option to choose a date range for a specific job or to view all reports.  Management can also add/ deactivate/ activate/ or delete users and jobs.</p>

                  <h2 class="text-center">Stock Market Time Machine</h2>
                  <p>This app was built as part of a group with two of my worthy constituants, David Palmquist and James Mulling, from the UNC coding bootcamp as our first major project in august 2017.  The initial idea of the project was this; What would have happened if we invested the money it takes to attend a bootcamp (approx. $10,000) in the dow jones index?  And we planned to make it almost a game to see who could make the best investment.  That idea morphed into its present idea; What if we had a time machine and could go back in time and invest this same amount of money in a porfolio of our choosing.  We also decided to add another feature where the user could inform their investment using historic news articles from the NYT about the companies in their portfolio.  The result is its present state.</p>
                  <p>The user (pick Austin to test) can select a portfolio of any size from one stock up to the entire dow 30, and reference news articles about that company from the NYT over any time period available.  He/She then picks a buying and selling date, and can see what the results of this investment would have been.  This could be used by investors to study the market of the past, or as an education tool to show how current news can affect a stock value.</p>
